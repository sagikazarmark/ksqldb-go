//
// CREATE, DROP, and TERMINATE statements returns an object that indicates the current state of statement execution.
// A statement can be in one of the following states:
//
//	QUEUED, PARSING, EXECUTING: The statement was accepted by the server and is being processed.
//
//	SUCCESS: The statement was successfully processed.
//
//	ERROR: There was an error processing the statement. The statement was not executed.
//
// TERMINATED: The query started by the statement was terminated. Only returned for CREATE STREAM|TABLE AS SELECT.
//
// If a CREATE, DROP, or TERMINATE statement returns a command status with state
// QUEUED, PARSING, or EXECUTING from the @Execute endpoint,
// you can use the @GetQueryStatus endpoint to poll the status of the command.
